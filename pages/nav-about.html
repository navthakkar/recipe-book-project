				<p>hello, world! my name is navya, & welcome to my recipe book :) i am currently a graduate student, living & studying in new york city! i love roller skating, dancing (badly) to music in my living room, reading (& re-reading) many books, printmaking, &, of course, cooking! </p>
				<p>before moving, i knew i would have to cook significantly more to be able to save money as a student in new york city. however, since my move to brooklyn, cooking has become my safe haven, something i can get lost in, something that makes me feel at home in this big, crazy city. i have always loved being in the kitchen, but this is the first time in my life i have free rein to make whatever i want! so i have been learning & experimenting lots. some dishes have been delicious, others an absolute mess. but i am so glad i now have a place to record my journey & share it with others!</p>
				<p>i decided to make my own recipe book, to record recipes of the dishes i love. additionally, i wanted to make a site that is easy to navigate, & recipes are easy to find. Online recipe pages these days have become very tedious to read & navigate, so i wanted to create something fun, simple, & cute! as for the ~retro~ vibe of the website - well, thatâ€™s just a bit of fun!</p>
				<p>this project started as an assignment for my <i>information technology</i> class, but has become so much more! my hope for this website is that it will be a space for me to continue recording my cooking & the recipes that i love. through this website, i hope to be able to share my love for cooking with the people i love - the community that supports me so fiercely!</p>
				<p>thank you so much for visiting! if you have any questions or want to share a recipe with me (please do, i will love you forever!), or you just wanna chat, you can email me at <a href="mailto:navyathakkar@gmail.com">navyathakkar@gmail.com</a> :) happy cooking!!</p>
