			<p>hello! welcome to my recipe book :) glad you are here! this page acts like a guide through the website - i just wanted to give you an overview of what is included & how to best use it!</p>

			<h2>guide</h2>
			<p>the main recipe book page is currently divided into two sections - one for normal cooking & another for baking. i hope to add more sections soon. each recipe card includes tags that describe the dish. there are some silly emojis thrown in as well, just to show how i feel about the dishes! anything with a <span id="black-tag" aria-label="heart">&lt;3</span> is a dish i am very fond of haha. clicking on a recipe card will take you to the recipe page.</p>
			<p>there’s a mix of recipes on this website - some of them, i’ve found online or on tiktok or instagram (they are a treasure trove for new & innovative recipes). some are dishes that i grew up eating, & others are recipes introduced to me by my friends & family. each recipe has its origins & sources listed on the recipe page, so you can find where i found them. all the recipes have been tried & tested by me before adding them to this website.</p>
			<p>on the recipe page, you will find the ingredients, instructions, notes about the process if needed, & some of my thoughts on the recipe! i have decided not to include cooking times for each recipe since a lot of that depends on the cook, but if there are any recipes that require significant prepping or cooking time, i will be sure to note that.</p>

			<h2>future updates!</h2>
			<p>in this section, i want to discuss some future updates i am planning for the website - this is to let you know how the website is evolving, but also to keep me accountable to keep working on this project :)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>i hope to add many more recipes to this website! i have a growing list of recipes that i have made, & a much longer list of recipes i want to try. i will try my best to keep updating the site as i cook!</li>
				<li>when my technical skills allow me to, i would love to add a search &/or filter section to the homepage of the website, so that you can search the recipe book for a specific recipe or filter by different recipe tags (like “vegan,” “indian,” “pasta,” etc).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>thanks for reading & i hope this helps! let me know if you have any questions (my contact information is on the about page) & happy cooking!!</p>
